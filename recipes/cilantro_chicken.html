            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine cilantro, olive oil, lime juice, lime zest,
                    minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper
                    in a bowl or plastic storage container. Add chicken and
                    coat well in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 
                    at least 2 hours, turning chicken occasionally.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
                    Remove chicken thighs from the marinade, rubbing garlic 
                    onto both sides of the chicken. Add chicken to the hot
                    oil and cook until brownded, about 4 minutes per side. 
                    Turn off burner and transfer chicken to a plate; set aside.</li>
                <li>Pour chicken stock and water into the Dutch oven,
                    scraping the botton of the pot with a wooden or plastic
                    spoon to loosen any browned bits. Stir in rice, lime juice,
                    and salt. Place chicken on top of the rice and cover with a lid.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and remove
                    chicken to a plate using tongs. Stir rice from bottom to top 
                    then place the chicken back on top of the rice.</li>
                <li>Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, until all the liquid
                    is absorbed, and the rice is soft, 15 to 18 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer cooked chicken to a plate and stir 2 tablespoons of
                    chopped cilantro and 1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest into the rice.
                    Fluff with a fork and serve with the chicken.</li>
